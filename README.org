#+TITLE: Dotfiles for nix

This repository supports installation of Nix on Ubuntu within WSL2. For now. The goal is for the configuration to be more general than that, but got to start somewhere.

nixpkgs contains my userland nix configuration, and is symlinked to $HOME/.config/nixpkgs via the install script

* Inspiration
Tbh, the inspiration for working with nix is so scattered and broken that I had to remove this section...

One source that made me realize I really need to understand this properly before diving in was the following channel on Youtube:

Nix needs to mature before going mainstream. Until then, head first into the peculiarities!

* To install nix
Follow instructions in the manual:
- https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#chap-installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
#+END_SRC

* To install the home-manager configuration in this repository
Follow the instructions in the home-manager repository:
- https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
  nix-channel --update
  nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
#+END_SRC
